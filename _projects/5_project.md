        SARS-CoV-2 sequencing capacity in Africa during the pandemic.

    <p>
        <strong>Strengthening Genomic Surveillance</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Since 2021, Africa CDC, through the <a href="https://africacdc.org/institutes/ipg/">Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative (Africa PGI)</a>, has expanded next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies across National Public Health Institutions in more than 45 African Union Member States.  This initiative has significantly enhanced genomic surveillance capacity, enabling real-time pathogen tracking, outbreak response, and data-driven public health decision-making. By strengthening regional sequencing networks, Africa CDC is fostering collaborative pathogen genomics efforts to combat infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance across the continent.

   <p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>

<p>
    During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a substantial increase in SARS-CoV-2 sequencing efforts on the African continent. This expansion has led to a deeper understanding of the virus's spread and evolution within diverse populations.
</p>

<p>
    The growth of genomic surveillance has been instrumental in identifying and tracking various SARS-CoV-2 variants as they emerge and circulate throughout Africa. By analyzing the genetic makeup of the virus from different regions, researchers have been able to monitor mutation patterns, assess the transmissibility of new variants, and evaluate their potential impact on public health measures and vaccine efficacy.
</p>

<p>
    The collaborative efforts among African nations have not only strengthened the continent's capacity to respond to the current pandemic but have also laid a foundation for tackling future infectious disease outbreaks. The integration of genomic data into public health strategies has facilitated more targeted interventions, informed policy decisions, and optimized resource allocation to the most affected areas.
</p>

<p>
    Despite these advancements, significant challenges remain. Ensuring equitable access to sequencing technologies, addressing data-sharing concerns, and maintaining sustained investment in genomic infrastructure are critical for the continued success of these initiatives. The study underscores the importance of ongoing support and collaboration to enhance genomic surveillance and improve public health responses across Africa.
</p>

<p>
    In summary, the rapid expansion of SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in Africa has provided invaluable insights into the virus's dynamics on the continent. This progress highlights the essential role of genomics in managing public health crises and emphasizes the need for continued investment and cooperation to strengthen health systems in Africa.
