        Schematic Showing the PHICAMS Project. The PHICAMS project (<a href="https://edctpalumninetwork.org/profile/300/">TMA2020CDF-3159</a>) aims to identify microbial pathogens, characterize clinical presentations, and determine comorbidities in HIV-infected children and adolescents with non-malarial febrile illness. This project leverages advanced sequencing technologies to improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
