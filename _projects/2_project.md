        Understanding the Drivers of Antimicrobial Resistance in East Africa: A Research Initiative Supported by Grand Challenges Africa
        Grand Challenges Africa enabled us to embark on a critical research study focused on the
        <a href="https://www.old.aasciences.africa/news/drivers-antimicrobial-resistance-east-africa">
        Drivers of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) in East Africa</a>. This generous funding marked a significant milestone in our efforts to address one of the most pressing global health challenges of our time.
    </p>
    <h4>The Significance of Antimicrobial Resistance</h4>
    <p>
        AMR threatens the effective prevention and treatment of infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. It is a growing concern in East Africa, where limited access to quality healthcare and the misuse of antibiotics exacerbate the problem. Understanding the factors driving AMR in the region is essential for developing targeted interventions and informing policy.
    </p>
    <h4>Our Research Goals</h4>
    <pre>
    ðŸ”¹ Investigate the Role of Healthcare Systems in AMR Transmission: 
     Examine how healthcare infrastructure and practices influence resistance patterns in Africa.  

    ðŸ”¹ Provide Actionable Data: 
     Generate insights to guide public health policies and interventions that can combat AMR effectively.
