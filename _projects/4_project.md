        <strong>RT-qPCR-Based SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VOC) Screening in Africa</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Africa CDC, through its Pathogen Genomics Initiative, launched a pilot project to enhance the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) across six African Union member states. This initiative addresses the urgent need for rapid, cost-effective methods to complement whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for tracking and monitoring SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Project Overview</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The project leverages the Thermo Fisher TaqMan SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Panel Molecular Genotyping Assay to rapidly detect and genotype SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. The six participating countriesâ€”Morocco, Senegal, Kenya, Gabon, Namibia, and Sierra Leoneâ€”were selected based on their existing WGS capacity, molecular diagnostics infrastructure, and the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 cases.
    </p>
    <p>
        The study will utilize nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples collected by the National Public Health Institutes (NPHIs) of each country. Positive samples with a cycle threshold (Ct) value â‰¤30 will undergo genotyping to identify SARS-CoV-2 mutations.
        </p>
        <strong>Objectives</strong>
      <pre>
      ðŸ”¹ Primary Objective: 
         Demonstrate the feasibility of deploying the commercial TaqMan genotyping assay for VOC detection  
         in routine surveillance.  

      ðŸ”¹ Secondary Objective:
         Document the prevalence of circulating VOCs in the participating member states in Africa.  
      </pre>

        <strong>Outcomes</strong>

        This project aims to enhance Africa's capacity to detect and monitor SARS-CoV-2 VOCs efficiently, addressing the current challenges of limited genomic surveillance in the region. By complementing WGS efforts, this initiative will inform public health strategies and support the control of COVID-19 in Africa.
  
        By pioneering scalable solutions, the project highlights the importance of regional collaboration and innovation in genomic surveillance amidst ongoing public health challenges.
