Hi! I am a PhD student at the University of Bristol and a part-time Data Scientist at both the [Jean Golding Institute](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/), UK and [Infectious Diseases Institute's ACE](https://ace.ac.ug/), Uganda. My PhD is funded by the Medical Research Council(MRC) under GW4 BioMed2 MRC DTP under the Population Health theme. My project under the supervision of [Prof Kristen Reyher](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/kristen-k-reyher), [Dr. Sion Bayliss](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/sion-c-bayliss), [Prof Andrew Dowsey](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/andrew-dowsey), and [Dr. Lauren Cowley](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/lauren-cowley) centers on collaborating with the UK Health Security Agency(UKHSA) to develop cutting-edge machine learning tools aimed at forecasting outbreaks of foodborne diseases. These tools are used to support public health decision-making and facilitate rapid response to future outbreaks.

I previously did an MSc in Bioinformatics supported by the Fogarty International Center(FIC) of the National Institutes of Health(NIH) under the EANBIT project at Makerere University where my research focussed on evaluating the practicality and broader adaptability of Machine Learning models, particularly in the realm of predicting antimicrobial resistance within low-middle-income countries(LMICs).

I am passionate about the field of innovations in global health and I have worked on a variety of projects spanning different domains, including virtual reality technology in medical education and the utilization of large language models for pandemic preparedness in LMICs.
