## **3. Implementation of Next-Generation Sequencing-Based HIV Drug Resistance Testing**  

**Focus:** Enhancing Antiretroviral Treatment Monitoring and Public Health Outcomes  
This blog discusses the integration of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) into HIV drug resistance testing, highlighting its superior sensitivity in detecting resistance mutations. Key steps include:  

- Data analysis  
- Clinical interpretation  

These steps improve patient outcomes by enabling timely adjustments to antiretroviral therapy.
