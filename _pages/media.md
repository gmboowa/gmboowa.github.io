## **2. Implementation of Next-Generation Sequencing-Based HIV Drug Resistance Testing**

### **Enhancing Antiretroviral Treatment Monitoring and Public Health Outcomes**
The blog discusses the integration of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) into HIV drug resistance testing, highlighting its superior sensitivity in detecting resistance mutations compared to traditional methods. This enhanced detection capability allows for timely adjustments to antiretroviral therapy, improving treatment efficacy and reducing the risk of treatment failure. Key steps for implementing NGS-based testing, such as sample preparation, sequencing, data analysis, and clinical interpretation, are outlined, emphasizing their importance in optimizing patient outcomes.

## **3. WHO EPI-WIN: Pathogen Genomics in Health Emergencies – Spotlight Cholera**


On December 12, 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) hosted a webinar focusing on the application of pathogen genomics in managing cholera outbreaks. This session highlighted how genomic data enhances understanding of cholera's transmission dynamics, thereby strengthening surveillance and informing public health interventions. Experts, including Dr. Timothy Dallman from WHO and Professor François-Xavier Weill from Institut Pasteur, discussed the integration of genomics into cholera response strategies. <a href='https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2024/12/12/default-calendar/who-epi-win-webinar-pathogen-genomics-in-health-emergencies-spotlight-cholera'>This was the second webinar by IPSN on EPI-WIN, in collaboration with the WHO Cholera Team</a>.

## **6. My PhD Defense Presentation**

This work aimed at identifying host-genetic factors influencing the progression of HIV-disease in Uganda and Botswana pediatric populations. It was funded by the Collaborative African Genomics Network (CAfGEN) of the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) as well as the Training Health Researchers into Vocational Excellence in East Africa (THRiVE) consortium.
